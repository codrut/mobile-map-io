# Hi

This project was started to reduce the amount of time spent on the most frequent tasks that beset a hacker at the outset of a project, namely: starting a mobile web app, getting basic mapping functionality to work, and setting up a simple CRUD API to move data between the app and cloud storage.

There are a few ways to get involved with this project.

# Share issues or ideas

If something doesn't work properly when you've cloned and followed the README.md directions, open an issue and share what OS version, environment, and other details about how you got to that point. Some issues arise only on iPhones or on Safari, for example. 

If you have ideas, be as brief or verbose as you like. Be aware though, not all ideas need be limited to this project; it might be better suited to an entirely new app based on this boilerplate! Feel free to fork and make it happen. I'll work with you on it.

# Behaving like a hacker

The inspiration for this project was based on experiences at hackathons, where people spend a huge portion of the time developing the basic tech framework and reimplementing design patterns. The community that might embrace this project should be held to the same values that inspired this project. See Major League Hacking's [values](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies/blob/master/community-values.md) and [other policies](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-policies) for what that means. This can also be broader than just the hackathon community; if you're prototyping any sort of app like this, see [Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) for how we will conduct ourselves in that scope.
